Finding out what skin type you have and how to treat that can be very hard when there are so many different websites that say contrasting things, or websites that don’t have all the information you need. Your Skin lets you know about skin types, what the best skincare routine is and about the products you are putting on your face. There is also a video tutorial that demonstrates how the products work. </p>

              <div class="cleanser-about">The Cleanser</div>
              <p class="c">A facial cleanser is a skincare product used to remove make-up, dead skin cells, oil, dirt, and other types of pollutants from the skin, helping to keep pores clear and prevent skin conditions such as acne. Most of the environmental impurities and cosmetic products our skin comes in contact with are not water soluble, so washing the skin with water isn’t enough to remove them. Skin cleansers remove dirt, sebum, oil and dead skin cells—ideally without damaging or irritating the skin. Remember, it’s important to cleanse your skin every night, but also in the morning too, to remove any toxins your skin eliminates during the night.</p>

              <div class="two">2</div>
              <div class="exfoliator-about">The Exfoliator</div>
              <p class="e">Exfoliation a skin-care technique where you remove dead cells from the top layer of your skin. By removing this layer of clutter off of your skin, exfoliation helps brighten your complexion, and lets your skin-care products penetrate deeper into your skin (making them work better.) As a general rule, less is more. The goal is NOT to turn beet red or to feel a sting—it’s to gently help along your body’s natural exfoliation process so that your face glows.</p>

              <div class="three">3</div>
              <div class="toner-about">The Toner</div>
              <p class="t">Facial toner is basically the in-between skincare step. It's meant to be used after washing your face but before using your serum or moisturizer. Face toners prep the skin for moisturizers and serum while getting rid of excess excess oil and stubborn dirt or makeup leftover on your face after you wash it. But they're not a replacement for washing your face. Just think of facial toners as the extra credit rather than the shortcut of your skin-care routine.</p>

              <div class="four">4</div>
              <div class="sunscreen-about">The Sunscreen</div>
              <p class="s">Wearing sunscreen is one of the best — and easiest — ways to protect your skin’s appearance and health at any age. Used regularly, sunscreen helps prevent sunburn, skin cancer and premature aging. For day-to-day use, pick a sunscreen with sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30. If you spend time outdoors, choose a product with SPF 60 or greater. In reality, most people do not use as much sunscreen as they should, and this higher SPF helps compensate.</p>

              <div class="five">5</div>
              <div class="eyecream-about">The EyeCream</div>
              <p class="ec">Like moisturizers you use on your face, eye creams include skin-restoring and replenishing benefit ingredients to help hydrate, reduce the appearance of puffiness and dark circles and defend against UV rays and other environmental aggressors. Many also contain anti-aging ingredients to diminish crow’s feet, fine lines and wrinkles. Most products are formulated with a combination of ingredients—so it’s best to choose an eye-cream based on your specific skin concern.</p>

              <div class="six">6</div>
              <div class="moisturiser-about">The Moisturiser</div>
              <p class="m">Moisturizers prevent and treat dry skin. They can also protect sensitive skin, improve skin texture and mask imperfections. You may need to try various products to find the right moisturizers for you. On the most basic level, moisturizers hold water in the outer layer of skin. Most moisturizers are water-based lotions, creams, gels and serums</p>
